# advent_of_code
my efforts at solving advent of code challenges. Enjoy.

# 2022
Only ever got around to solving challenges until day 9. Too much politics going on I suppose.

# 2023
For this year I commited after solving the first part, and commited again after finishing the second. This way it is possible to derive solution of part one from the history.

# 2024
during my masterthesis i didnt get around to solving a lot.
